# debbie
This project is built in fulfillment of the requirements for the module ET1024-2420: Introduction to Engineering &amp; Design CA3. 
It aims to develop a desk-stationed companion robot, Debbie, designed to combat loneliness in the comfort of our homes.  
  
__How can we help individuals in Singapore combat loneliness through the use of technology? (UNSDG 3)__

## Component Lists and Functions
**WiFi & Blynk IoT** [*Blynk by Volodymyr]  
**LCD screen** : *Displays an introductory message from debbie during setup, followed by display of its face.*    
**Motor** : *Controls the movement of debbie, which is managed remotely through the Blynk software.*    
**Ultrasounic sensor** *2 : *Detect obstacles in debbieâ€™s path; when an obstacle is detected, the buzzer sounds, and debbie stops moving even if commands are sent from the app.*  
**Buzzer** : *Sounds when an obstacle is detected by the ultrasonic sensors*  
**Target Board** *1 : *Detects flashlight (representing darkness). When detected, LED automatically turns on; when the flashlight is removed (representing a well-lit room), the LED turns off.*  
**Temperature & Humidity Sensor** [*DHT sensor library by Adafruit] : *Measures and sends temperature and humidity data to the Blynk app.*  



## Component Functions
debbie will introduce itself via lcd during initial set up. then the face will appear throughout. 
movement is remote controlled from blynk software. ultrasonic sensors will detect obstacles and when detected buzzer will sound. debbie will be brought to a halt even when movement command is given from the software. temperature and humidity values are shown on blynk app.
target Board will detect flashlight (represent darkness) then led will automatically turn on. when flashlight is removed (represent back to well-lit room) then led will automatically turn off. 

## Usage
1) Test all the hardware seperately.  
2) Create Blynk account >> template >> Hardware: ESP8266 | Connection type: WiFi >> New Devices  
3) debbie_esp01.ino
4) Blynk template id, name, auth token and personal hotspot  

## Common Error
```
ESP is not responding
```
Restart your robot  
Change laptop(some laptops don't have default file path configured)  
Change hotspot(might be network error)  
Change SoftwareSerial EspSerial(12, 13); to different ports e.g. (2,3)  
```
Compilation error: ESP8266_Lib.h: No such file or directory
```

paste in C:\Users\(yourname)\OneDrive\Documents\Arduino\libraries\Blynk\src  


> [!CAUTION]  
The ESP8266 (ESP-01) baud rate *must* be set to 9600, while the Serial.begin()/Serial Monitor baud rates can be either 9600 or 115200.
The code is currently at its maximum and will overload if added more  
Beware of damaging your components
